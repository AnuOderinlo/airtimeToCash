#AIRTIME TO CASH APP

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Airtime  TOCash allows users to sell their airtime for cash. It features a wallet which holds
the funds users receive in return for sold airtime and allows for withdrawal of those
funds into the userâ€™s designated bank account.
</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
  Individuals often send monetary value to their loved ones by sending Airtime. Telcos
also allow direct transfer due to this existing demand. Oftentimes, users will receive
credit bonuses or accidentally buy more airtime than they require. Many users currently
attempt to sell this off using social media. The search for an interested buyer can take
days. This is a time during which the Users have value, but no utility.
</p>
<p>
Users in these scenarios can directly sell their airtime for cash thus providing them with
the utility to make other purchases or transactions on-platform.
